YOUR NAME :: SUGGESTION

Robert :: Use Rails 

Fake Name :: More Tacos

David Brown :: Finish the project early!

Will :: Use GitHub and Git to manage the project. By using GitHub we can take advantage of Issue Tracking the Wiki which will assist with project tracking.
AngularJS on the front end makes working with data very easy (i.e. displaying lists, handling logic). We should consider using it for our project.

Will :: Perhaps we can organize group teaching sessions for the project? For example, someone who is familiar with Git can do a walkthrough so that members who don't know can learn it, and be able to use it with the rest of our project.

Robert :: If someone wants to write a tutorial for GIT or any other tutorials to get students up to speed please send them to me at robert@morouney.com and I will post them here!

Robert :: Anyone who doesn't have experience with Ruby on Rails should read this: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/zero-to-sixty-creating-and-deploying-a-rails-app-in-under-an-hour--net-8252
I think it would be a good option for the backend and make the development process smoother. I have a fair amount of experience with Rails and Ruby is very similar to python so it is not a very steep learning curve.
